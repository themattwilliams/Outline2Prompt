# Outline2Prompt
A modular Jupyter Notebook application for reverse-engineering expert outlines into AI generation prompts, complete with scoring and iterative tuning.
Below is a detailed README document for your project, based on the PRD. You can adjust sections or wording as needed.

Outline2Prompt is an interactive Jupyter Notebook tool designed to reverse engineer human-generated outlines into high-quality AI prompts. By extracting key components—including structural elements and SEO best practices—from provided inputs, PromptForge generates initial prompts and iteratively refines them using a detailed evaluation rubric. The goal is to help prompt engineers and data scientists achieve AI-generated outlines that match or exceed the quality of a human benchmark.

## Overview

PromptForge is built as a modular, interactive system within a Jupyter Notebook environment using ipywidgets. The tool streamlines the process of converting a human-created outline (and optional SEO-related source code) into an AI prompt. It then uses an external AI API to generate an outline and evaluates that output against a detailed rubric. Users can iteratively refine the prompt until a preset quality threshold is achieved.

This solution is designed for data scientists, prompt engineers, and developers who need a systematic, feedback-driven approach to optimizing AI-generated content.

## Key Features

- **Modular Input Interface:**  
  Easily paste or upload human-generated outlines and source code via interactive text areas and file upload widgets.

- **Automated Analysis:**  
  Extract key structural components and SEO elements from the input, presenting insights in a user-friendly format.

- **Prompt Generation and Customization:**  
  Automatically generate an initial AI prompt based on the extracted insights, with an interface that allows manual refinement and adjustment.

- **AI API Integration:**  
  Seamlessly connect with external AI models to generate candidate outlines based on the current prompt.

- **Detailed Evaluation Rubric:**  
  Evaluate generated outlines on metrics such as structure, content relevance, clarity, and SEO integration using interactive widgets for scoring.

- **Iterative Refinement Workflow:**  
  Allow users to continuously update the prompt based on evaluation feedback, with each iteration logged and compared.

- **Version Control and Reporting:**  
  Maintain a history of iterations, enabling users to review progress and export reports summarizing the final prompt, output, and scores.

## User Stories and Use Cases

- **Input Collection:**  
  As a user, I can paste a high-quality human-generated outline and optionally upload source code to extract SEO practices, so that I have a benchmark for quality.

- **Component Extraction:**  
  As a user, I can view a breakdown of key structural and SEO components extracted from my input, which guides the prompt creation process.

- **Prompt Formulation:**  
  As a user, I can see an automatically generated prompt based on the analysis, and adjust it if needed before sending it to the AI model.

- **AI Generation and Evaluation:**  
  As a user, I can trigger the AI model to generate an outline and then evaluate its quality using a detailed rubric, providing feedback on each evaluation metric.

- **Iterative Refinement:**  
  As a user, I can update the prompt based on evaluation feedback and re-run the generation cycle until the output meets my quality standards.

- **Version History:**  
  As a user, I can review a log of previous iterations, comparing changes, scores, and feedback to understand the evolution of the prompt.

## System Architecture

PromptForge operates entirely within a Jupyter Notebook, using ipywidgets to build an interactive user interface. The system is divided into independent modules:

- **Input Module:** Captures and configures user-provided data.
- **Analysis Module:** Processes and extracts key insights from the outline and SEO source code.
- **Prompt Generation Module:** Converts insights into an AI prompt.
- **AI Integration Module:** Handles API communication with an external AI model.
- **Evaluation Module:** Provides an interactive interface for scoring and feedback.
- **Iteration Module:** Facilitates prompt refinement and logs each iteration.
- **Reporting Module:** Summarizes iteration history and exports final results.
